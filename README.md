## Velero Community Meetings

Happens on every 1st and 3rd Tuesday of every month at 4pm UTC. These public online meetings will be focused on: updates on work towards the next release, answering any Velero related questions you may have, and an opportunity for you to give us direct feedback.

To get a calendar invite to these meetings, please join the [Velero Google Groups discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/projectvelero) and you should get an invite immediately into your inbox.

## Suggest an topic

If you have an idea for a topic of discussion please [open an issue in the Velero community issue tracker](https://github.com/heptio/velero-community/issues).
We generally pick topics around features we are working on, but we want to hear what is of interest in the Velero community.
If we select your suggestion we will give you a shoutout on during the online meeting!

*Note: Velero was previously known as Heptio Ark. Past meeting notes, videos, etc. have been retained as-is for posterity.*
